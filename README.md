# 🚀 GoRest API Automation Testing

## 🎯 About the Project
This project is an automated testing project for the GoRest API using Cucumber, Serenity BDD, and RestAssured. GoRest is an API service used for testing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources such as users, posts, albums, and more. The primary goal of this project is to ensure that the API endpoints work as expected, validate the responses, and verify the correctness of the data returned by the API.
